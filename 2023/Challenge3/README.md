# About The Project
---
This project started from the [Challenge Of Wits 2023 (Challenge 3)](https://www.dtcareers.gov.sg/files/Challenge3_Answer.pdf). I took on this challenge to learn something new and discovered the Dijkstra and A-star algorithms, which helped me solve the question. To satisfy my curiosity, I added a graph plotting feature as an additional enhancement.
